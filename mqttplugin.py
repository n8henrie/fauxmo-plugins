"""Fauxmo plugin for simple MQTT requests.

The on and off methods publish a value to the given MQTT queue. The get_status
method subscribes to an MQTT queue to asynchronously receive the status
published from the device. If the device doesn’t publish a status via MQTT then
omit the state_cmd and the plugin will return a status of “unknown”. The status
received from the device is passed back unchanged to fauxmo which is expecting
“on”, “off” or “unknown”.

Behaviour of the plugin is not entirely predictable if mqttserver and mqttport
are omitted, please make sure to set in your config.

Example config:

        `initial_state` may be required when initially adding a MQTT device to
        Alexa, as the `state_cmd` is called asynchronously instead of on
        demand. This means that when adding a new device, Alexa will likely get
        an `"unknown"` result, which the Fauxmo server will discard as invalid
        and fail to return a successul response to the Echo. Setting an
        arbitrary `initial_state` should allow the device to be added, and
        after the first call to the `on()` or `off()` methods the state should
        be properly updated and reflected on subsequent `get_state()` calls.
